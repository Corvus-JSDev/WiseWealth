# WiseWealth
A one-stop-shop for understanding things like: If you can afford and qualify for a mortgage, what is your actual take-home pay, what is your debt-to-income ratio, and how much is that new car actually going to cost you.

### <a name="#about">About</a>

Like lots of people my age, trying to understand exactly how this complex financial system works can be daunting and tiresome. It also doesn't help that some financial sites can be completely wrong, and others are too complex for someone to grasp quickly. So I made an all-in-one shop for understanding things like: If you can afford and qualify for a mortgage, what is your actual take-home pay, what is your debt-to-income ratio, and how much is that new car actually going to cost you.

### <a name="#about">How To Use</a>

I've tried to make WiseWeath as user-friendly as possible. All you need to do is simply input the corresponding information (such as: price, tax rate, interest rate, etc.) and the rest will be automatically calculated.

There are four tabs: Mortgage, Auto Loan, Take Home Pay, and Debt-to-Income ratio. Each is pretty self-explanatory in what they calculate. A lot of take-home pay calculators use a blanket tax rate. For example, if you're in the 22% tax bracket, their calculator will simply do income minus 22%. The issue with this is that's not **at all** how tax brackets work. The US tax bracket system divides taxable income into ranges with progressively higher tax rates, which this calculator takes into account and provides the real amount of tax that will be collected.

### Tools used

I mainly wanted to focus on JavaScript logic for this project, so the tech stack is relatively simple.
